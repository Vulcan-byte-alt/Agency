We are looking for a talented Web designer to create the top section of the home page for our digital marketing agency. The design should be modern, sleek, and high-end â€” something that immediately communicates quality and sophistication.

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING KEY REQUIREMENTS.
Do not send generic templates that do not incorporate the following requirements. They will be rejected without review.


- When the page first loads, our tagline should be the first thing visitors see. "Big Agency Work. Small Agency Energy."

*** PLEASE INCORPORATE OUR PORTFOLIO SAMPLES (attached) in a prominent grid or masonry format. Designs that show generic samples (or ones that are not ours) will NOT be considered. ***

- Our logo and nav bar should appear at the very top, of course.

- Dominant color is red.

- The design should emphasize premium visual appeal and showcase our portfolio work beautifully.


For this contest, please focus only on the top portion of the home page (above the fold). If your design is chosen, you will be hired to complete the full home page and rest of the site.

Here are some examples we like:
